    "description": "Development of Custom Frame Configurator for Shopify Integration\n\nIntroduction\nWe require the development of a custom frame configurator to be integrated into our Shopify store. The configurator should allow users to customize their frames in real-time, with dynamic previews reflecting the selected choices, and enable users to add their customized product to the cart for checkout.\n\nWhat we will provide:\n\nPre-configured products: All frame products and variants will be pre-configured and ready to be incorporated into the configurator. Each frame will have various options like color, size, and material, which need to be configurable by the user.\nTest Shopify store: We will provide a test Shopify store where the configurator can be developed and tested.\nProduct and configuration details: We will supply all necessary details for product cataloging and configuration, including descriptions, images, and pricing information for each variant.\nKey Features and Requirements:\n\nDynamic Frame Preview:\n\nThe page should open with default preset choices (e.g., default image, default support, etc.).\nA dynamic preview of the frame should be shown, which updates based on the user’s selections (image, dimensions, support, frame, passepartout, etc.).\nImage Selection:\n\nThe user can upload their own image or choose from available images on the site.\nIf an image is uploaded, the system should automatically switch to \"Free proportions\" mode for the dimensions.\nDimension Selection (Numeric Input):\n\nUsers can input custom width and height values (in cm), with limits (minimum 10x15 cm, maximum 140x140 cm).\nThere should be quick selection buttons for standard formats (e.g., 3:2, 4:3, 16:9, A4), which will lock the dimensions according to the selected aspect ratio.\nThe default mode should be \"Free proportions\" unless an image is uploaded.\nSupport Selection:\n\nThe user can choose between the following support options:\nPhoto Paper (10€/m²)\nCanvas (20€/m²)\nNo support (no print)\nThe price should be calculated based on the selected support material (price per square meter).\nOuter Frame Selection:\n\nThe outer frame will have a thickness of 4 cm and a price of 10€/m.\nThe user can choose a color from a pill selector, filtering all available frame models in the chosen color.\nThe price will be calculated based on the perimeter (length) of the selected frame.\nFirst Passepartout Selection:\n\nA numeric input for the dimensions of the first passepartout (minimum 2.5 cm, maximum 15 cm) for each side.\nThe user can also choose the color of the passepartout via a pill selector.\nThe price will be calculated based on the area of the passepartout (price per square meter).\nSecond Passepartout Selection:\n\nThis will function similarly to the first passepartout but will be optional and applied only if the first passepartout is selected.\nThe price will be calculated based on the area of the second passepartout.\nSecond Frame Selection (External to the Second Passepartout):\n\nAvailable only if the first frame is chosen with the required features to allow a second frame.\nThis frame will have a thickness of 2 cm and a price of 5€/m.\nThe user can select the color from a pill selector, which filters the models by color.\nThe price will be calculated based on the perimeter of the second frame.\nFront Part Selection:\n\nAvailable options:\nGlass (15€/m²)\nPlexiglass (18€/m²)\nMirror (20€/m²)\nNone (0€)\nThe price will be calculated based on the area of the front part, which depends on the frame dimensions (including the artwork, passepartout, etc.).\nBack Part Selection:\n\nAvailable options:\nCardboard (15€/m²)\nMDF (18€/m²)\nFlorentine Paper (20€/m²)\nThe price will be calculated based on the area of the outer frame.\nFor frames smaller than 20x30 cm, there will be options for back parts suitable for placing the frame on a surface.\nHanging Hooks Selection:\n\nThe user can choose between three fixed hook options.\nEach hook option will have a fixed price.\nSummary Box:\n\nA summary box should display all the selected options, showing a breakdown of the customized frame and the associated prices.\nDynamic Price Calculation:\n\nThe price should be dynamically updated based on the user’s selections (support, frame, passepartout, hooks, etc.).\nThe pricing formula should include: Support + Outer Frame + First Passepartout + Second Passepartout + Second Frame + Front Part + Back Part + Hanging Hooks.\nImage Generation:\n\nThe final product preview image (including all selected components) should be generated dynamically.\nThe uploaded image should be cropped and adjusted according to the selected dimensions.\nA schematic with the product dimensions (including measurements) should also be generated dynamically.\nResponsive Design:\n\nThe configurator should be fully responsive, adapting to various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).\nBackend Management:\n\nA backend system should be provided for easy management of the configurator (products, prices, variants, etc.).\nThe backend should allow easy updates for options, pricing, and images.\nThe system should also track orders for customized products.\nShopify Integration:\n\nThe configurator should seamlessly integrate with Shopify for both order processing and product inventory management.\nOnce the user finalizes their customization, they should be able to add the custom product to the cart and proceed to checkout through Shopify.\nDevelopment Timeline:\n\nWe estimate that the project will take approximately [X weeks] for development, testing, and integration with the Shopify store.\nWeekly meetings are requested to track progress and address any issues.",

The core functionality of the app is to help users locate nearby businesses offering \"happy hour specials on food, drinks or experiences.\"\n\nKey Features For the App:\n= Each happy hour location should have comprehensive information, including:\n= business address, directions, reviews and ratings, menu and prices, and photos of the location, products and experiences.\n\n- The app should also incorporate:\n= \"Call Location\" Feature for clients who would like to call location\n= Booking/Reservation ability if the location permits\n= Share Button to share deals, locations, reviews and photos.\n= Save/Favorite Location button\n= An easy to use back end \"offer section\" for clients to add/edit happy hour deals on the app and computer back end. \n= An experience survey after the client visits the location, this can be detected via geofencing or receipt upload (as proof of purchase)\n\nAdditional Features Requested:\n= An AI Chat Bot to answer basic user queries about each specific location. Hours, product availability, parking details, etc.\n= Referral / affiliate code customers can share with their contacts to receive kick back promotion from participating locations.\n= \"Influencer\" section/portfolio where our registered \"influencers\" can be \"invited/incentivized\" by participating businesses to redeem a special offer put on by the business to influence the purchase or customer to visit that location for the offer. This will help participating businesses create temporary controlled incentives/offers to promote our \"influencer\" clients to visit the business and redeem the offer advertised specially for customer profiles we tag as \"influencer\"\n\nWe would like to create this app as a \"Digital Billboard\" to help existing businesses showcase their happy hour offerings and hours offered. Mainly, providing this service without interfering or requesting preferred customization marketing material for our business, in an effort to keep everything simple. Based off feedback with early adopters, we are considering not accepting payments for customer transactions, we will make our revenue from charging businesses a fee to advertise their happy hour offerings on this new app. If you have another view point on this or worked on a similar project and have another recommendation, we want to hear from you.\n\nWe want to use this app to simply showcase existing happy hour offers at advertised times, at participating locations and keeping the relationship simple. Charging business a $x to advertise/showcase happy hour offers. \n\nRegular customers can register for free, however we require some form of verifying that only adults can use the application because we will be advertising adult businesses (vape, smoke lounges, night clubs, etc). \n\nWe will be Charging influencers $x for access to the influencer section/customer tag to via temporary custom promos from businesses to influencers. Ex. business can send an influencer an offer for \"5 people, includes table reservation and bottle of wine + chicken wings for $49.98\" in an effort to bring those influencers to the business location to capture the deal outside the regular happy hour offerings advertised.\n\nWe are open to additional ideas/feedback you may have about improving this project, we are looking for a long time partner and this relationship would be ongoing for the developer or team to maintain and update the new application for us as improvements and suggestions are requested at future dates.\n\nIdeal Skills and Experience:\n- Extensive experience in mobile app development for both Android and iOS.\n- Prior work on location-based services is a plus.\n- Proficiency in integrating AI chatbots into mobile applications.\n- Expertise in creating user-friendly interfaces for easy navigation and interaction.\n- Experience in incorporating social sharing features within a mobile app.\n- Developer or Team looking to have some fun as we grow this project\n\n- We are accepting offers, nothing is turned down and every application will be considered.",

    "description": "Proposal and Proof of Work Requirements for Dynamic Excel Sheet Development\n\nWe are seeking an experienced Excel developer to create a dynamic, visually appealing, and proprietary tool for our loan officers. This tool will enable our team to present purchase and refinance scenarios to clients, offering detailed calculations, comparisons, and insights. It should reflect Cohen Mortgage branding, include precise mortgage insurance premium calculations for different loan programs, and be protected to maintain its proprietary nature.\n\nProject Scope and Features:\n\n1. User Data Entry Inputs:\n- Property address\n- Purchase price\n- Down payment percentage\n- Loan amount (calculated automatically)\n- Interest rate (fixed or adjustable options)\n- Loan term (e.g., 15, 20, 30 years)\n- Loan Program (Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, Jumbo)\n- Annual property taxes\n- Annual homeowner’s insurance premiums\n- Annual homeowner's association dues; if applicable\n- Mortgage insurance premiums (calculated based on loan program)\n\n2. Loan Program Customization:\n- FHA Loans: UFMIP (1.75%), MIP based on LTV and down payment.\n- VA Loans: Funding fees based on down payment; exemptions for eligible borrowers.\n- USDA Loans: Upfront and annual guarantee fees.\n- Conventional Loans: User-defined PMI rates, with auto-termination at 78% LTV.\n- Jumbo Loans: No MI but accommodate higher loan limits.\n\n3. Key Functionalities:\n- Monthly payment breakdown with charts and visuals.\n- Closing costs estimator.\n- Amortization schedules with early payoff options.\n- Future refinance scenarios.\n- Rent vs. own analysis.\n- Side-by-side comparison of 3 scenarios.\n\n4. Branding:\n- Include Cohen Mortgage logos, colors, and fonts.\n- Professional header and footer with contact info and disclaimers.\n- Consistent visual style across outputs.\n\n5. Protection and Security:\n- Lock all formulas, calculations, and branding elements.\n- Password-protect the sheet to restrict editing to user input fields.\n- Include a disclaimer asserting proprietary ownership.\n\nProof of Concept Requirement:\nTo ensure alignment with our expectations for the consumer-facing portion of the tool, we request a mockup or proof-of-concept report. This will help us evaluate the visual appeal and layout before committing to the full project.\n\n1. Visual Appeal:\n- Clean, professional layout incorporating Cohen Mortgage branding.\n- Charts, graphs, or tables summarizing key loan information.\n- Space for payment breakdowns, closing costs, and scenario comparisons.\n\n2. Key Elements to Include in the Mockup:\n- A breakdown of monthly payments (PITIA) in a clear format.\n- Estimated amounts due at closing, including down payment and program fees.\n- Comparison of scenarios (e.g., loan options with different terms or rates).\n- Optional elements: amortization summaries, rent vs. own analysis, refinance benefits.\n\n3. Format:\n- Provide the mockup as a PDF, screenshot, or Excel file demonstrating only the consumer-facing report portion.\n- The mockup does not need to be functional at this stage.\n\n4. Evaluation Criteria:\n- Alignment with Cohen Mortgage branding. (See Instagram page @cohenmortgage & visit website www.cohenmortgage.com; logo and branding guidelines attached)\n- Clarity and professionalism of the layout.\n- Ability to present complex information in a simple, easy-to-understand format.",
